[Economic Market Monitor (In Progress)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PUR9nESFKTJ6fuzZSdnxPh7a8i5LmSPM)
###### This notebook incorporates economic data from multiple sources, particularly from the St. Louis Federal Reserve and Yahoo! Finance, to look at economic trends and attempt to find patterns/indicators of possible future recessions/economic downturns.
[Bitcoin Institutional Premium - Grayscale Bitcoin Trust](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1D47cTfiS3IusotSgQKHMEkPm9jzsNy3_)
###### This notebook compares the BTC-USD price with the current GBTC price via Yahoo! Finance. An increase in the implied premium for GBTC could be an indicator of an increase in institutional demand for Bitcoin as GBTC is a registered investment vehicle that allows investors to indirectly own BTC. Shares of GBTC are eligibile to be held in various retirement accounts (IRA, Roth IRA) as well as brokerage accounts that otherwise would not allow ownership of Bitcoin.
